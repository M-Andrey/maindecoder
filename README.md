# maindecoder
Hi! I am Russian software engineer. Team Lead. Video about me https://vk.com/wall-73375965_14179 I wrote this program, especially for Google, as it had crashes and did not work for more than an hour due to an overflowing data store. With this example, I want to show Google developers and get an idea of organizing decoding of large video files and working with cloud storage.

In detail, what would the program work I will describe tomorrow May 11, 2021
